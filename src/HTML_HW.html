<h1>Re:Eileen Dover university application</h1>
Dear Eileen,<br>
<p>Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part of your PhD next year. I
    will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.
</p><p>Starting dates: 1 Sep 2020, 1 Oct 2020</p>
<p>We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you could start at the
    beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:</p>

    <li>Second semester: 15 January 2017</li>
    <li>Third semester: 2 May 2017</li></ul>
<p>Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.</p>
